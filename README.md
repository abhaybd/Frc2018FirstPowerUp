# Frc2018FirstPowerUp

This is a branch to test swerve drive. The development will happen on the branch called [SwerveDrive.](https://github.com/coolioasjulio/Frc2018FirstPowerUp/tree/SwerveDrive) This branch is dedicated to testing the implementation without using the robot. It will be kept up to date with the other branch as development continues.

This branch has code to create mock motor controllers and gyros, and run a swerve drive object, printing status to the console. Additionally, I made a simulator in Unity3D, which uses RPC to communicate with the swerve implementation in this library. This simulator will allow you to actually drive the robot. It's cool. The simulation is [here.](https://github.com/coolioasjulio/FrcDrive)

In order to run the simulation, run RPC.java FIRST. Then, start the unity scene, and it will connect.
